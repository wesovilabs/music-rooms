# Getting started with Elixir and ecosystem

## Purpose
 
 The purpose of this article is sharing with other geeks my experience developing an application with Elixir.  A few months ago I just did
 some researches coding with Erlang and to be honest I really enjoyed it writing the *[article](https://github.com/wesovi/js-freeze_vs_seal)*, but this time  I will go for a more real application which could provide me with some better feedback
 about the functional programming language.

 After reading this post you will have received some tops on how to write and run your Rest application and then I invite yourself to 
 do some improvement into my code by pull requests or even free to fork it and implement new functionality.
 
 Below a description about the application we will be coding.
  
 **The Music Rooms Site**
  
   A site that will available channels which will be associated to a playlist in Spotify. To access into a channel the user will introduce his/her email 
   and will be required to choice a channel.
   
   Once the member is connected to the channel the system will display the list of users connected to this channel and the tracks in the playlist.
   
   Any member in the channel will be able to add new tracks to the playlist.
